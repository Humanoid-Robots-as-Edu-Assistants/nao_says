# "nao says" for NAO robot [v.1.3]
*This project supports 2 languages. It is available in german and english!*<br>

### How the Game works

The game "NAO says" (based on Simon says) was developed for the "Long Night of Science Berlin" in 2022. 
Before you start the program, you can choose in which language Nao the game starts automatically.
(You can also set how many tasks Nao plays with the participants if you wish.) 
The robot briefly explains that if he says "Nao says: [Task]" you should imitate him 
and if he doesn't say "Nao says" you shouldn't. After that, Nao plays the game with the participants. 
80% of the time he says "Nao says" before a task. A maximum of 12 tasks are currently available. 
These are run through in random order and are not repeated.


### What do you need?

any NAO version

### Plans of further development:

We are currently not planning any further development. <br>
Of course, the program can be expanded to include additional tasks.
